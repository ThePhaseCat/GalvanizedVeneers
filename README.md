Why did I make this into a mod? Because I saw that no one else did it, so yeah...

This mod adds
- Galvanized Square Steel, made from iron, which falls unless you use...
- Expansion Screws, also made from iron, used to hold Galvanized Square Steel in place!
- Wood Veneers, made from oak planks
- And a Music Disc, made by combining both!

For full recipes, they're in the recipe book!
